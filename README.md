#### Description of R scripts
- **CONSTANTS.r**: define folder paths and line color/types for plotting 
- **draw-individual-disease-plot.r**: plot group of similar trajectories
- **pool-proportions.r**: perform meta-analysis on static characteristics described with percentages/proportions of subjects with said characteristic of the class/trajectory in question
- **pool-risk-factors-and-outcomes.r**: perform meta-analysis on risk factors/outcomes (potentially) associated with a derived group of similar trajectories
- **summarize-country-data.r**: extract and summarize descriptive country statistics from the included studies
- **summarize-data-extractions.r**: extract data items extracted from the included studies and populate a table with these data 
- **summarize-detailed-study-score.r**: quantify computational methodology robustness and plot these data
- **summarize-meta-analysis-statistics.r**: extract descriptive statistics of the performed meta-analyses (e.g., number of meta-analyses performed in total)
- **summarize-primary-and-secondary-study-numbers.r**: quantify the number of primary and secondary studies
- **summarize-quality-assessment-and-year-data.r**: summarize methodological quality assesments and yearly publication trends
- **summarize-trajectories-number-determinants.r**: quantify and plot length of follow-up, number of diseases investigated, and number of assessment time points in relation to the number of trajectories identified
